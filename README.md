Voron V0 Umbilical Cover plate with Strain Releif

This Mod was created to help with strain put on the connector of the umbilical but giving a place to clamp the cables in place and reduce flex of the connector.
I wanted to create something that would allow for removal of the connector without screws or loss of cable ties.
Thai was my solution and has served me well so far.
My V0 has undergone many maitainence and revovals of the umbilical and it still working as intended.
